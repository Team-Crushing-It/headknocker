\n 3. Each category will include five (5) randomly selected questions (one from each difficulty level). For instance, if the host selects five categories the game will include 25 questions. 
\n 4. Each player will have the opportunity to select a question on a rotating basis. The host is the first player to select a question.

\n 6. Each player will have 30 seconds to answer the question. If a player does not answer within the allotted time, they will not receive any points.
